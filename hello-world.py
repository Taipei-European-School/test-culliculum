"""

A Hello World test assignment.

Create a function named `hello` which:
 * Takes zero arguments.
 * Prints "Hello, World!" to `STDOUT`. 
 * Returns `None`. 

Please keep in mind that all tests are case and space sensitive. So that means
"hello world" or "hello, world!" or "Hello, world!" will all fail the test.
Python has a brain, but it's not very smart.
